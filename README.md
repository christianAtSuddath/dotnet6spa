March 2022: We are hiring!
Applicants must be able to legally work in the USA and are preferably located in the Eastern or Central time zone.

To be considered do the following:

- create a fork of the project (or clone it and send us the link)
- change the "Fetch Data" functionality from hard-coded values in the controller to be retrieved from a SQLite database (1 table)

We are looking for the following in your fork:

- a sql lite database with one table to hold the temperatures and dates
- a service class that uses Dapper to retrieve the temperatures from the database and unit test
- the service being used in the weather forecast controller to retrieve the data
- one angular component unit test using Jasmine and Karma

For additional bonus points:

- change the angular app to use angular material styling
- create a component for temperature CRUD operations using reactive forms
- add the required endpoints to the weather forecast controller
- add the required CRUD methods to the data service

For even more bonus points:

- secure the app with the identity provider of your choice (Google, etc) using OAuth and the angular-auth-oidc-client version 11+, if possible implementing PKCE flow

Finally, submit a pull request for your fork as well as your contact information!
